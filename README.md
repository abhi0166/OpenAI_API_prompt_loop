# OpenAI_API_prompt_Engineering
This code is to create OpenAI API Assistants and create threads to use code interpreter

Added brief comments on every block in the code.

I have implemented a solution to run different variations(Prompt with full name, first/last names, multiple names, non-existing name from dataset and random as well) of prompts with different models and examine the output and build an understing on how each model performs for the given task and analyze if there's a truncation issue and understand how each model behaves and solves the question with different prompts.
